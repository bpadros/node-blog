### What I have learned

When I create this project I want to learn more about node.js , so i decided to create a blog-news web application , where i can understand more about the back-end part of the project.
I was very interested in creating a web application where I can register as a user and after that i can post something to share to all my friends and the world.


## Source

I decided to create this project because I love to write movies reviews so this a good way where I can post my articles after watching a movie and share to all the people.
